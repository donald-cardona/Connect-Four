# Connect-Four

Second project for my profile. This game is similar to tic-tac-toe except that there are more rows and columns and one must win
by 4 in a row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal.

Players must insert chips and chips can only fall onto the bottom most spot of a column that is unfilled just like the real game.
There is also a message displayed for the outcome of the game.
